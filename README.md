# PDF Text Analysis

PDF Text Analysis is a Python script that downloads a PDF from a URL, converts it to text, and performs text analysis. The text analysis includes detecting the language of the text, removing stopwords, and counting the frequency of words and phrases. The script supports multiple languages.


## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- [requests](https://pypi.org/project/requests/)
- [PyPDF2](https://pypi.org/project/PyPDF2/)
- [nltk](https://pypi.org/project/nltk/)

## Usage

1. Run the script: `python3 main.py`
2. Enter the URL of the PDF you want to analyze
3. Enter a word or phrase to search for in the text (optional)
