# PDF Text Analyzer

PDF Text Analyzer is a Python script that downloads a PDF from a URL, converts it to text, and performs text analysis. The text analysis includes detecting the language of the text, removing stopwords, and counting the frequency of words and phrases. The script supports multiple languages.


## Requirements

To run the script, you need to have Python 3.x installed on your system. You also need to install the following libraries:

- [requests](https://pypi.org/project/requests/)
- [PyPDF2](https://pypi.org/project/PyPDF2/)
- [nltk](https://pypi.org/project/nltk/)
- [langdetect](https://pypi.org/project/langdetect/)


## Usage

1. Run the script: ```python3 main.py -u "https://www.example.com/document.pdf" -s "example phrase"```
2. Enter the URL of the PDF you want to analyze
3. Enter a word or phrase to search for in the text (optional)
4. The script will then download the PDF, extract the text, and perform analysis on the text
